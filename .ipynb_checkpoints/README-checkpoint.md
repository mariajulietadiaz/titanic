## Project Overview

The Titanic Survival Prediction project focuses on predicting whether a passenger survived or not, based on features such as age, fare, passenger class, family relations, and more. This analysis covers:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Data Cleaning
- Model Training and Evaluation
