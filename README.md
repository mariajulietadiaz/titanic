# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Description and Objective
The **Titanic Survival Prediction** project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. Using historical passenger data, we explore, clean, and analyze the dataset to engineer features and train predictive models to identify patterns that distinguish survivors from non-survivors.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Check missing values  
- Analyze variable distributions  
- Examine correlations  
- Detect outliers

---

## Feature Engineering & Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values  
- Create new features: Age segment, Fare segment, Relatives, Alone, Name length  
- Encode categorical variables  
- Drop unnecessary features

---

## Data Preparation
- Split features and target  
- Apply PCA (if needed)  
- Train-test split  
- Scale features

---

## Predictive Modeling
- Logistic Regression (benchmark)  
- KNN  
- Decision Tree  
- SVM  
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)  
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning

---

## Ensemble Methods
- Bagging: Random Forest, Bagging Classifier, Extra Tree Classifier  
- Boosting: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting  
- Voting Classifier

---

## Feature Importance
Identify key features impacting survival prediction.
